Apparently to define model, we need to make a list of length three which inculdes the 3 variables: samples, timesteps, features. Batch size must be a common factor of the length of the training set, and units is how many predictions will be made.

#dim(data_ts) = c(length(data_ts), 1, 1)

#All this does is set single variables instead of keep in a list
#bruh1 = dim(data_ts)[2]
#bruh2 = dim(data_ts)[3]
